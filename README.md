The random password generator helps generate a password mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols for security.
 </p>

The python script generates a random password of 8 characters. Each time the program is run, a new password is generated randomly.
The password generated is 8 characters long and includes the following characters in any order:
<ul>
<li>2 uppercase  letters from A toZ</li>
<li>2 lowercase letters from a to z</li>
<li>2 digits from 0 to 9</li> 
<li>punction signs such as !,?,>] etc</li>.
 </ul>
The ASCII Code has been used to generate code for presenting English characters as numbers, which each character is assigned a number from 0 to 127.<br>
